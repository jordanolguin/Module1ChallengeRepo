# Code Refactor Starter Code

This is a complete rundown of the updates made to Horiseon Digital Marketing's Website to clean up the code file and improve the SEO.

## HTML Refactoring

I updated the HTML source code to semantic HTML elements to help create a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. I added accessible alt attributes to all of the images. All of the heading attributes also fall in order. I also updated the title to be concise and descriptive. By doing so, the code file is easier to manage and the SEO for the website is improved!

## CSS Refactoring

I consolidated and renamed .class and #id elements to reflect the updates made to the HTML source code. I reclassed some elements (please refer to the comments added to both HTML and CSS source codes) to help with logic and flow. The files now follow semantic structure.
